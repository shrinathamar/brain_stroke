Abstract : This is a Binary Classification type of problem. 
           This project predicts the brain stroke in patient after observing the his/her medical condition.
           
Key features : 
[gender,	age,	hypertension,	heart_disease,	ever_married,	work_type,	Residence_type,	avg_glucose_level,	bmi,	smoking_status]
target = stroke

Description :  we perform various various stepts EDA , Feature engineering, feature selection, and train model with different classification model.
               With Decision tree we got very good accuracy after prunning. hence, we conclude that Decision tree is the best suited for this Dataset.

Final Model Selection  : Decision Tree 
Accuracy score         : 94 % (test data)
